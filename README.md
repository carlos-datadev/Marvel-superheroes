# Marvel Super Heroes

For this project i used the following versions:

- Latest version of pandas (2.2.3) 
- Latest version of requests(2.32.3)
- Python 3.9.0

This should work fine if you have the lastest version of Python, but if you have a different one iÂ´ve included a dockerfile so you can just build and run it.
